### Article Summary

Are you interested to see how recurrent networks process sequences under the hood? That’s what this article is all about. We are going to inspect and build our own custom LSTM/GRU model. We test then in a trivial task of sine waves sequence predicion. Moreover, we make some comparisons between recurrent and convolutional modules, to maximize our understanding.

This tutorial serves as an illustration of multiple concepts of recurrent neural networks. We carefully built upon the ideas, in order to understand sequence models that handle time-varying data. We did our best to bridge the gaps between RNN’s in computer vision. In the next part, we will see under the hood of a GRU cell and analyze them side by side.
